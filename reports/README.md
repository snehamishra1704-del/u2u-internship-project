# Educational RAG Tutor - Project Report

## Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to upload educational PDF documents and ask questions based on their content. The system retrieves relevant information from the uploaded documents and generates accurate answers using an AI language model.

## Features

- Upload educational PDF files
- Extract and process document text
- Split text into chunks
- Generate embeddings for semantic search
- Retrieve relevant content using cosine similarity
- Generate context-aware answers using GPT

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Tkinter
- NumPy
- PyPDF
- OpenAI API
- text-embedding-3-small
- GPT-4o Mini

## Workflow

1. PDF Upload
2. Text Extraction
3. Text Chunking
4. Embedding Generation
5. Similarity Search
6. Context Retrieval
7. Answer Generation
